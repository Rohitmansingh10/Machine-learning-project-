        "### **Types of Optimizers**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Gradient Descent (GD)**:\n",
        "   - **Description**: It is the most basic optimizer, where parameters are updated by moving in the direction of the steepest negative gradient of the loss function.\n",
        "   - **Example**: In linear regression, GD adjusts weights to minimize the mean squared error between predicted and actual values.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**:\n",
        "   - **Description**: A variation of Gradient Descent that updates parameters using one random sample at a time, making it faster but noisier.\n",
        "   - **Example**: For large datasets, SGD is often used in neural networks to update weights after processing each data point.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**:\n",
        "   - **Description**: A compromise between GD and SGD, where updates are made after processing a small subset (mini-batch) of the data.\n",
        "   - **Example**: In deep learning, mini-batch gradient descent is commonly used to train models on large datasets efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Momentum**:\n",
        "   - **Description**: Enhances SGD by adding a \"velocity\" term, which helps accelerate convergence by considering previous updates, smoothing out the steps.\n",
        "   - **Example**: In training deep neural networks, Momentum helps escape local minima and reach the global minimum faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Adagrad**:\n",
        "   - **Description**: An adaptive learning rate method that adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on its past gradients, giving more attention to infrequent features.\n",
        "   - **Example**: In sparse data scenarios (like text classification), Adagrad gives higher learning rates to features with sparse gradients.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **RMSprop**:\n",
        "   - **Description**: An improvement over Adagrad, it divides the learning rate by a moving average of recent gradients to maintain a more stable learning rate over time.\n",
        "   - **Example**: RMSprop is widely used in training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for time-series tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)**:\n",
        "   - **Description**: Combines the benefits of Momentum and RMSprop by using both the first moment (mean) and second moment (variance) of gradients for adaptive learning rates.\n",
        "   - **Example**: Adam is one of the most popular optimizers in deep learning for its fast convergence and efficient performance in large-scale problems.\n",

        "8. **Nadam (Nesterov-accelerated Adaptive Moment Estimation)**:\n",
